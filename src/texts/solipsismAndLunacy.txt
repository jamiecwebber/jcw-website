SOLIPSISM AND LUNACY


I've come to think of as "solar" a viewpoint that present itself as logical, rational, orderly, structured, linear, binary, categorical and decisive. I think of as "lunar" the points of view that are emotional, intuitive, chaotic, fluid, non-linear, pluralistic, transcendent and ephemeral. For the person who's become completely solipsistic all that there really is is $colour1{POWER}, and for the lunatic all that exists any more is $colour2{LOVE}.

This is a binary that has very often been mapped onto the gender binary of male and female. My words have often been misinterpreted for this reason. There is a lot to be said on this subject, surely entire books yet to be written, and hopefully I can unpack some of this here within the safe and fair confines of my own writing space. These are words that have a lot of meaning to a lot of people and it's absolutely necessary to tread lightly as a result.

The interesting irony of this is that to divide things between a philosophy of the Sun and the Moon is itself a binary, categorical distinction that is only really tenible in the light of day. Thus this blog also necessarily contains /all that is left unsaid/, the impossible shadow-side of the language that exists between the words and only in feelings and textures surrounding the experience. These things have been spoken of a million times in as many different ways all through history and all around the world.

My belief is summed up in a twisting, or maybe not such a twisting, of the words and meaning of Martin Luther King Jr. - “{Power} without {love} is reckless and abusive, and {love} without {power} is sentimental and anemic. {Power} at its best is {love} implementing the demands of {justice}, and {justice} at its best is {power} correcting everything that stands against {love}.”
