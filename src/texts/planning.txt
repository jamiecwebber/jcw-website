....What text is needed for website?
	-> everything needs to be translated + accessibility stuff (do your virtue signalling)

-> Main page welcome blurb


BLOG
-> might be something where "self-discipline" and a more serious schedule might do right
-> some posts
	-> Presenting my VST and combination tone grid instrument & its connection with Vivier's music
	-> Vivier and connection to first nations music
	-> Talking the theory of spectral music, and how it relates to FM synthesis
	-> defining the binary as structure & order vs fluidity & intuition

How to write a blog post
-> research the hell out of the subject
-> keep taking notes
-> basically treat it like writing an essay in University

-> need basic ability to smoothly make simple graphics/display things
	-> could almost even use HTML/CSS and take screenshots! blah




-> Longer bio
-> Short blurb to show up in links somehow (when you first land on a page in the site, on the side there is a little face with 10-15 words)
		-> Jamie Webber composes and programs avant-garde microtonal music and likes to write about how the way we think influences the way we are

CV describing "accomplishments"

-> Descriptions of pieces


-> from a "solar" point of view, I am trying to establish myself here as a valid person contributing to the conversation. It will be possible to connect the different parts of my work and to bring them to the public by sharing popular interest science blog posts. Emotionally speaking everything I am working on has the goal of promoting humans and that's pretty cool. I will have personal benefit and also can do my work to promote the wellbeing of other people.
